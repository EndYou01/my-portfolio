We jointly clarify doubts and questions related to it, also creating two different views, one for the mobile version and another for the desktop version, adding of course the necessary CSS media queries. The different sections of the information contained in the website were loaded dynamically from an API, as well as the products that are presented there, as well as the different elements of the graphical interface. I strive to offer quality solutions based on the use of best practices in web development, remote work, agile methodologies and the speed with which I deliver the results, with the highest level of professionalism.",

In the development phase we were involved two developers for the creation of the site in the shortest possible time, it was not difficult since only a Front-End team was necessary. With this work I felt more pressure with aspects such as leadership in front of a team and being the one who faces the client, than the development process."

They gave me the instructions of functionalities that they wanted to appear and the images of all the products. By not providing me with any API,. JSON or database I had to make a Mock with all the parameters of each product to then be able to work.",

I created the animations as they appeared, making use of libraries such as react-image-magnify for the zoom effect when hover the image of the ProductPage tab, animate.css for others a little more basic and react-awesome-reveal for the first appearance of the components."
