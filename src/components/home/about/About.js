            <p>I am a full stack software engineer with 3+ years of experience building fullstack websites and mobile applications. I have worked alone, and with other teams of professional developers creating modern and robust software. I mainly work on frontend codebases using ReactJS , but I can most certainly learn any JS framework and tool. I am also experienced with backend languages and frameworks like NodeJS, as well as SQL and noSQL databases.</p>
